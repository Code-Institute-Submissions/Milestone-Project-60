# The Career Changers

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1


![The Career Coachers Interactive Design](https://github.com/mkthewlis/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/assets/images/README%20image%20MS1.png)


*The Career Coachers* is a fictional career coaching service that offers guidance and support to clients hoping to change their careers. 
The idea for this project came to me as I was going through this transition myself and thought it could be interesting to create a service
for others in the same situation. Instead of only relying on articles, podcasts and opinion pieces, I liked the idea of building a
coaching service that would help guide young clients throughout their transition.

This was the first of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at *The Code Institute*. 
The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

## UX

### Main aims

- To fill a gap in the careers coaching market, by specifically appealing to younger clients who might feel unsure of where to begin and would like to find a source of guidance throughout this process.  

- To make *The Career Changers* service seem credible, by creating a design that was both streamlined and professional. 

- To make it easy for users to quickly navigate their way to the 'Contact Us' page to potentially increase the client base for the fictional business owners. 

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

1. I am a user who wants to change career path. I need to be convinced that this career counselling service can meet my needs and that they are reliable. I also want to easily navigate my way through the website before making the decision whether to contact this company or to continue my search online.

2. I am a user who works for a competing career counselling service. I want to know what this company offers, including their price and package details.

3. I am a user who is still unconvinced about whether I might need support as I change my career. I want to get into contact with *The Career Changers* as I have come across their profile on LinkedIn and am curious about their services. I want to reach out to them and schedule a call for more information.

4. I am a user who primarily uses an iPad Pro to browse websites. I want to have a good experience on this website and view all the features in an equally aesthetic way. 

5. I am one of the owners of *The Career Changers*. I want a website that will provide information about our services, attract potential clients by seeming welcoming and increase the number of people who get in touch with us.

### Design Process

![My workspace on Figma](https://github.com/mkthewlis/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/assets/images/figma_screenshot.png)

1. I began the design process by outlining the key features that I wanted my website to have and thought about what might be the most intuitive way to navigate through each page. This led me to decide on the four pages I would have on my website: 'Home', 'About Us', 'Our Services' and 'Contact Us'.

2. The first major design decision was to keep the home page as clear and streamlined as possible, with a large hero image and a gripping title that would engage the user straight away. I had a rough idea of what I was looking for (namely, someone who looked pensive at work) and when I came across [this image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-a-man-using-laptop-3771790/) I knew that it could form the basis of the rest of my design.

3. I started a workspace on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Hv9GYC33ydTGLuwIxydgRr/Code-Institute?node-id=0%3A1) and began experimenting by making a wireframe. I tried using different colours, fonts and structures for my four pages. All of the colours for this project were ultimately taken from this original image, including the light blue (#dce3ed) and light brown (#7a7573) that are paired together throughout the design project. 
I also found the two fonts that I would use consisteny, as I thought they worked well together to come across as professional and yet also unintimidating: Open Sans and Nato Sans KR. 

4. I continued to make changes to my original design idea throughout the project. I designed the logo after I had started builing the website and added more content about the founders than initially intended. I also made a significant change to the structure of the 'About Us' page as I thought that would provide a better user experience.

> Note: Throughout the design process, I kept referring back to my original 'Main Aims' and 'User Stories' to make sure that my project was developing as intended.


## Features

### Existing Features

This project has four seperate pages, each found by clicking on the corresponding name on the menu. 

#### Consistent features across all pages

- A menu header with *The Career Changers* logo on the left (which leads a user back to 'Home' when clicked) and links to the other pages on the right. 
- The footer is also consistent across all pages with links to social media profiles there.

#### Home

- The main title across the hero image slides into view from the right.
- The 'Schedule call' button brings the user directly to the 'Contact Us' page.
- Three quick reasons why a user should use this service with icons to represent each one.

#### About Us

- Three interactive images of the founders that transition into full colour when hovered over.
- A short overview of the company, including how and why it was founded.

#### Our Services

- More details about why a client should use this particular service.
- A bulletpoint list of what is included in the price.
- Another 'Schedule Call' button to lead the user directly to the 'Contact Us' page.

#### Contact Us

- Contains a form that the user fills in; all fields have to be completed to submit the form.
- On submission, a modal message appears to confirm their submission.

### Features Left to Implement
- I considered adding a section with reviews from previous clients. This could be something that the business owner might add in the future.

- With technology that extends beyond the scope of this project, it could be interesting to add a member's section to the website where current and previous clients could log in to share ideas, chat and offer each other support.

- Another additional feature that goes beyond the scope of my first project would be to include a feature to get in touch with the support team directly by logging in to the member's section.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
    * The language used to create the form and add content to the website.
- CSS3 
    * The language used to style the HTML5 elements according to the design colour scheme.
- [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    * I decided to use Bootstrap's grid container system as I wanted to design my project with a 'mobile first' approach.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
    * Figma helped me crystalise my design ideas, including colour scheme, font style, image placement and overall page layout.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    * I relied on five free FontAwesome icons for my design project.
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) 
    * This was the source of all of the images in my project.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * I used one Google Font to create my logo and two more to style the content of the website.
- [Gauger Fonticon Generator](https://gauger.io/fonticon/) 
    * This free interactive Fonticon Generator allowed me to create a fonticon with a Font Awesome icon and style it with the colours from my colour scheme.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    * This was a great tool throughout the project to test my HTML and CSS code.
- [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I've refered to WSC Schools throughout the project, especially when designing the modal for my contact form, as described [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * Although it isn't a technology, I found a lot of guidance on Stack Overflow and used [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609273/convert-an-image-to-grayscale-in-html-css*/) to help me make images interactive on hover.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

Based on the User Stories listed above:

1. This user has already decided they want to change their career before they arrive at the home page. By chronologically following the items in the menu they learn more about the founders of the company, its history, what they specialise in and what is included in the price. Eventually they reach the 'Contact Us' page and submit their form to get in touch.

2. The employee of a competitor reaches their goal with one click by going to 'Our Services' and scrolling down to the details about the package and price. 

3. The unconvinced user may spend more time on the website, checking the details on each page, including the social media links. Several buttons throughout the website would take them to the 'Contact Us' page when they are ready, where they can submit the form to get more information.

4. All elements of the website are responsive on smaller screens, so the design is still visually appealing on the user's iPad Pro.

5. The owner would notice that the website has a consistent design and branding throughout and that it provides information about the services. They would see that the 'Contact Us' page would let their customers get in touch with them.

### Validating the HTML and CSS code

My code documents passed the following tests:
- HTML: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Testing different browsers

I manually tested the website on the following web browsers, checking that buttons, responsiveness and design worked as planned:
- Google Chrome 
- Mozilla Firefox 
- Apple Safari

### Testing responsiveness

I manually tested the live project by doing the following:

- Using Google Developer Tools to view the project on devices with different screen sizes.
- Asking for feedback from friends and family who opened and interacted with the project on their devices.

> NOTE: As my project was built with HTML and CSS, the modal that confirms a user has submitted their details appears even when the form is not completed. With the technology to do so, I would try to implement a function to prevent this from happening.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

WORK IN PROGRESS


# Intro


One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

### Validating the HTML and CSS code

### Browser testing

I manually tested the website on the following web browsers:
- Google Chrome 
- Mozilla Firefox 
- Apple Safari

Doing so lead to the follwing results:
- Chrome: the worked well on all screens. (Note: I used Google Chrome when building my project)
- Firefox: the 'Contact Us' button had a different border, with a white outline instead of blue colour from my theme 
- Safari: the horizontal divider on the 'Contact Us' page was not aligned correctly 



### Testing responsiveness




In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
