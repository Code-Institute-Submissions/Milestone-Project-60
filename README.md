# The Career Changers

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1

--- 

*---A boutique coaching service aimed at helping those who want to change their careers.*

[The project can be viewed here.](https://mkthewlis.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/)

---

My idea for this project came as the result of going through a career changing process myself. Leading up to the beginning of my studies with the Code Institute, I had spent a lot of time reading and researching about the process. I had read through countless articles and listened to podcasts made by others who had successfully changed their careers.
However, sifting through information online also led me to finding several career coaching services that seemed to offer advice and guidance to clients who knew they wanted to take their careers in a different direction. 
Although interesting, I found that most of these services didn't seem accessible for younger workers, including millennials, who perhaps hadn't had as many years of working experience as other clients might. 

Given my experience of exploring the websites of different career coaching services, I thought that I would try to design a website that would appeal to a diffent market by offering a less formal approach. Consequently, my main aim was to make a website that was very easy to navigate, would not seem intimidating to young career changers and yet would still be credible as the fictional founders are career changers themselves.

## UX

---
 
My idea with 'The Career Changers' was to fill a gap in the market, by appealing to users who might feel confused by the conflicting sources on information online about the process of changing their career.

With this in mind, I wanted to design a platform that prospective career changers would feel relieved to find; a coaching service that would guide them throughout the process.
Having reached out to the company, the user would be matched with an individual career coach and would work
closely with them from the first meeting to the final interview of a future job. In so doing, it would take away the user's stress and anxiety from being overwhelmed by other sources of information; instead, they would feel that they could rely on an expert with experience in their particular field.

To make The Career Changers service credible, I knew that this fictional organisation would have to come across as reliable and professional. I therefore wanted the design to be simple and streamlined, with a sutble colour scheme and all of the key information readily available.
However, I also wanted the website to not come across as intimidating. To do this, I knew that I should start by finding a hero image that would draw the user in by seeming relatable. This idea also inspired me to include photos of the founders to add a friendly and 'human' element to the organisation. 

Before beginning to design the project, I worked with the following User Stories:

- I am a user who wants to change career. Despite having done my fair share of research online I was at a loss as to where to start. I remember thinking that it would be great to have some support along the way. Eventually I found this boutique coaching service and navigated my way through the website to schedule a call with them. I am now a client and will soon start applying for jobs in a different field. Success!
- I am a user who works for a competing career counselling service. I wanted to quickly navigate my way through the website to find the price and package details of what was on offer. I found the information I needed on the third page.
- I am a user who is still unconvinced about whether I might need support as I change my career. I wanted to get into contact with The Career Changers as I came across their profile on LinkedIn and am curious about their services. I found my way to the contact page and completed form. I am now waiting to hear back from them to schedule a call for more information.

I also knew that I wanted to make the website easy to navigate as the owners of The Career Changers would want the user to easily find their way to the contact button to increase sales. 

With the users defined, my initial design process was focused on testing colour combinations and finding an appropriate hero image. To do this, I set up my workspace on Figma and began exploring different design ideas.
All colours from the project were ultimately taken from this original image, including the light blue (#dce3ed) and light brown (#7a7573) that are paired throughout the design project. I also found the two fonts that I would use throughout the project, as I thought they worked well together to come across as professional yet unintimidating: Open Sans and Nato Sans KR.

## Features

---

### Existing Features

This project has four seperate pages for a user to navigate through, each found by clicking on the corresponding name on the menu. Across all pages, the manu bar remains consistent, with 'The Career Changers' logo on the left (which, when clicked, leads them back to Home) and the other pages aligned on the right side. The menu is fully interactive and responsive on smaller screens. Similarly, the footer remains consistent on each page with links to social media profiles there.

- *Home*: This is the first page that the user comes across. Here, they are met with an image of a man who looks as if he is thinking about changing his job, whilst looking up at the title and a 'Schedule call' button. Below the image, the user finds three quick reasons why they should use this boutique career coaching service. 



- *About Us*: The user meets the three founders of The Career Coachers at the top of the page. As they scroll down, they find a short history of the company and where the idea came from.
- *Our Services*: The top of this page features a statement that reassures the user that this service will help guide them throughout their career changing journey. It then explans on the three reasons to use the company below and then leads to a section with an outline of the features. 
- *Contact Us*: This page is designed to be welcoming, yet also simple, as it only features a contact form to encourage the user to get in touch. 

### Existing interactive features:

- *(All pages) Menu bar*: Allows all users to intuitively navigate through the website deisgn, gradually learning more information before reaching the 'Contact Us' page to schedule a call.



- *(All pages) Social media icons on the Footer*: Each icon links the user to the corresponding social media page so they can interact with the company and find more information. 
- *(Home) 'Schedule Call' button*: Allows users an alternative way to navigate straight to the 'Contact Us' page. This has two functions: it makes the process easier for the user and could increase revenue for the business owners as it allows for a quicker commitment.
- *(Home) Main title*: The title slides in from the left as the user enters the page, adding an interactive element on first sight, immitating how a thought might slide into our minds.
- *(About Us) Three founders images*: Upon hover, the images change from greyscale to full colour as the names underline too. This adds to making the founders approachable to the user as they appear 'warmer' and in focus when the user hovers over them.
- *(Our Services) 'Schedule Call' button*: Another schedule call button is featured below the list of features included in the standard package. Again, this allows the user to navigate straight to the contact form if they feel ready to commit.
- *(Contact Us) Contact form*: This is the final stage for the user to get in touch. All input points in the form are required, meaning that the business owner is guaranteed to get the information they need from the user to get in touch with more information about the services. 

### Features Left to Implement
- I considered adding a section with reviews from previous clients. This could be something the business owner might add in the future.



- With technology that extends beyond the scope of this project, it could be interesting to add a members section to the website where current and previous clients could log in to share ideas, chat and offer each other support. Additionally, it could include a feature to get in touch with the support team there too.

## Technologies Used

---

The main aim of this project was to make a responsive, static website using HTML5 and CSS3. 
To achieve this, I used the following technologies:

- HTML5
    * The language used to create the form and add content to the website
- CSS3 
    * The language used to style the HTML5 elements according to the design colour scheme.
- [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    * I decided to use Bootstrap's grid container system as I wanted to design my project with a 'mobile first' approach.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
    * Figma helped me crystalise my design ideas, including colour scheme, font style, image placement and overall page layout.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    * I relied on four free FontAwesome icons for my design project.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * I used one Google Font to create my logo and two more to style the content of the website.
- [Gauger Fonticon Generator](https://gauger.io/fonticon/) 
    * This free interactive Fonticon Generator allowed me to create a fonticon with a Font Awesome icon and style it with the colours from my colour scheme.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    * This was a great tool throughout the project to test my HTML and CSS code.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * Although it isn't a technology, I found a lot of guidance on Stack Overflow and used [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609273/convert-an-image-to-grayscale-in-html-css*/) to help me make images interactive on hover.

# Template below:


One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
