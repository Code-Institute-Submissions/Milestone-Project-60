# Code Institute: Milestone Project 1

## The Career Changers

*---A boutique coaching service aimed at helping those who want to change their careers.*

My idea for this project came as the result of going through a career changing process myself. Leading up to the beginning of my studies with the Code Institute, I had spent a lot of time reading and researching about the process. I had read through countless articles and listened to podcasts made by others who had successfully changed their careers.
However, sifting through information online also led me to finding several career coaching services that seemed to offer advice and guidance to clients who knew they wanted to take their careers in a different direction. 
Although interesting, I found that most of these services didn't seem accessible for younger workers, including millennials, who perhaps hadn't had as many years of working experience as other clients might. 

Given my experience of exploring the websites of different career coaching services, I thought that I would try to design a website that would appeal to a diffent market by offering a less formal approach. Consequently, my main aim was to make a website that was very easy to navigate, would not seem intimidating to young career changers and would be credible as the fictional founders are career changers themselves.

## UX
 
Deciding to change your career can be an intimidating process. Although the decision itself may not be so difficult, knowing where to start and how to proceed can be as daunting as walking blindfolded into a forest. This is especially true as there are plenty of articles, opinion pieces and books readily available that offer advice and suggestions to make the process as smooth as possible. 
As a user faced with so many options, it could be tempting to get trapped by the research phase and therefore feel unable to actually begin.

With this in mind, I came up with the idea of 'The Career Changers'. I wanted to offer prospective career changers an alternative to the confusing mix of advice and suggestions online. Rather than continuing to jump between different pieces of advice, I wanted to offer a coaching service that was streamlined in its advice. The user would be matched with an individual career coach and would work
closely with them from the first meeting to the final interview of a future job. In so doing, it would take away the user's stress and anxiety from being overwhelmed by other sources of information; instead, they would feel that they could rely on an expert with experience in their particular field.

To make The Career Changers service credible, I knew that this fictional organisation would have to come across as reliable and professional. I therefore wanted the design to be simple and streamlined, with a sutble colour scheme and all of the key information readily available.
However, I also wanted the website to not come across as intimidating. To do this, I knew that I should start by finding a hero image that would draw the user in by seeming relatable. This idea also inspired me to include photos of the founders to add a friendly and 'human' element to the organisation. 

With this in mind, I began by searching for an appropriate image to use on my landing page. Once found, I set up my workspace on Figma and began exploring with the colour theme there.
All colours from the project were ultimately taken from this original image. 

My workspace on Figma can be found on the following link, with earlier versions of my project design shown underneath: https://www.figma.com/file/Hv9GYC33ydTGLuwIxydgRr/Code-Institute?node-id=0%3A1

Throughout the design process, I worked with the following User Stories:
- I am a user who wants to change career. Despite having done my fair share of research online I was at a loss as to where to start. I remember thinking that it would be great to have some support along the way. 
Eventually I found this boutique coaching service and navigated my way through the website to schedule a call with them. I am now a client and will soon start applying for jobs in a different field. Success!
- I am a user who works for a competing career counselling service. I wanted to quickly navigate my way through the website to find the price and package details of what was on offer. I found the information I 
needed on the third page. 
- I am a user who is still unconvinced about whether I might need support as I change my career. I wanted to get into contact with The Career Changers as I came across their profile on LinkedIn and am curious about their services.
 I found my way to the contact page and completed form. I am now waiting to hear back from them to schedule a call for more information.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

# Template below:


One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
